    The user asked: {question}
    
    You have received the answers from three AI models (GPT, Claude, and Gemini).
    
    TASK: Carefully review ALL THREE answers from the context above, then:
    
    1. **For GPT's answer:**
       - Identify strengths
       - Identify weaknesses
       - Identify any hallucinations or missing context
       - Suggest specific improvements
    
    2. **For Claude's answer:**
       - Identify strengths
       - Identify weaknesses
       - Identify any hallucinations or missing context
       - Suggest specific improvements
    
    3. **For Gemini's answer:**
       - Identify strengths
       - Identify weaknesses
       - Identify any hallucinations or missing context
       - Suggest specific improvements
    
    4. **Comparative Analysis:**
       - Which answer is most accurate?
       - Which answer is most comprehensive?
       - Which answer is most accessible?
       - What's the best approach from combining all three?
  expected_output: >
    A detailed comparative critique of all three delegate answers with specific examples.

final_answer:
  description: >
    The user's original question was: {question}
    
    You have received:
    1. Three independent answers from GPT, Claude, and Gemini
    2. Three detailed critiques analyzing all answers
    
    TASK: Synthesize the BEST POSSIBLE final answer by:
    - Taking the strongest points from each model's answer
    - Avoiding the weaknesses identified in the critiques
    - Ensuring accuracy and completeness
    - Making it clear and accessible
    
    Your final answer should be better than any individual response.
  expected_output: >
    A refined, comprehensive final answer that represents the best synthesis of all inputs.
